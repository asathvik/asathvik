Port forwarding is set up with the following command:
ssh -f -N -L 3361:faclsna01smdb15:3360 10.183.100.115

This was done because of the firewall issue.
Replication is relying on port forwarding to work until the firewall is opened.

Example:
CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST='localhost',
MASTER_PORT=3361,
MASTER_USER='replslave',
MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
MASTER_LOG_FILE='binlog_faclsna01smdb15_11.000400',
MASTER_LOG_POS=79394118;
